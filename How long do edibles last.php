                <h3><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a7e6d0d7-7fff-92ec-2fbb-cff79bbc6837">How long do edibles last?</strong></h3>
                <p><br />
            An edible high generally lasts much longer than smoking or vaping, from six to eight hours.<br />
              <br />
              Among edibles that contain THC, peak blood levels occur around three hours
            after administration. That&rsquo;s when the effects are likely to be the most intense.<br />
            <br />
                  As with onset time, the length of an edible high depends on a variety of factors, including the dose and potency. The high from products that are chewed and swallowed may last longer than the high from products that are absorbed orally.<br />
                  <br />
                  Individual factors, such as metabolism, weight, and tolerance, also affect duration.<br />
                  <br />
                  Yet, it may not be possible to predict how long the effects of edibles will last. In a 2016 study
                   researchers analyzed over one hundred thousand tweets about edibles. An &ldquo;unpredictable&rdquo; high duration was one of the most common adverse effects listed.<br />

                  <strong>Common forms of edibles</strong><br />
                  <br />
                  Edibles come in many different forms, and new products come onto the market almost daily. Common types of edibles include:<br />
                  Baked goods: brownies, cookies, biscuits, and waffles.<br />
                  Candy and sweets: gummies, chewing gum, lozenges, lollipops and hard candy, chocolate, truffles, fruit bars, and marshmallows.<br />
                  Beverages: coffee, tea and iced tea, soda, energy drinks and shots, beer, wine, and alcohol.<br />
                  Other products: jerky, butter, sugar, and syrups.<br />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How much should you take?</strong><br />
                  Most edible cannabis products identify how much THC or CBD is in a single serving. For instance, a single gummy typically contains 10 milligrams (mg) of THC.<br />
                  <br />
                  In some cases, though, the manufacturer lists the THC or CBD content of the entire package or food item. To use the gummy example, a package might contain 100 mg of THC. If the package contains 10 gummies, that&rsquo;s 10 mg per gummy.<br />
                  <br />
                  This can be quite confusing with food items such as brownies and cookies. In some cases, it might mean that a single dose corresponds to a fraction of the item.<br />
