                <h3>Choosing a 420 Strain</h3>
            <p>Traditionally, determining the answers to the following questions has helped a person find the correct strain of marijuana for them:<br />
              Why are they interested in using marijuana?<br />
              Is it for medical purposes, and if so, what conditions need treatment?<br />
              Is it for recreational purposes, and if so, what kind of experience do they seek?<br />
              How much experience do they have with marijuana?<br />
              How long do they want the experience to last?<br />
              However, much more research into the categorization of different strains and their effects is now necessary.<br />
              <br />
              In an interview
              in the journal Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research, Dr. Ethan Russo &mdash; a psychopharmacology researcher and neurologist &mdash; suggests a strong case against what people generally believe about the indica vs. sativa debate.<br />
He suggests that researchers cannot and should not categorize cannabis based on its &ldquo;effects&rdquo; and biochemical content, as the names &ldquo;indica&rdquo; and &ldquo;sativa&rdquo; simply refer to the plant&rsquo;s height, branching, and leaf morphology.<br />
&ldquo;Since the taxonomists cannot agree, I would strongly encourage the scientific community, the press, and the public to abandon the sativa/indica nomenclature and rather insist that accurate biochemical assays on cannabinoid and terpenoid profiles be available for cannabis in both the medical and recreational markets. Scientific accuracy and the public health demand no less than this.&rdquo;<br />
&ndash; Dr. Ethan Russo<br />
<br />
<strong>Summary</strong><br />
Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica have different botanical properties.<br />
Anecdotal evidence suggests that sativa is more energizing and indica is more relaxing, but the scientific reality is far more complicated. In fact, many different chemical compounds are involved in creating the medical and recreational effects of cannabis.<br />
Although there may be some truth to the differences between the two plants, it is important for a person to look at the biochemical content of the individual strains in order to choose the strain most suited to their needs.<br />
Even within the specific strains, research has proven that there is a huge possible variation in THC content, which suggests that the same is true for other cannabinoids.<br />
