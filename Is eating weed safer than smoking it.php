                <p>Though smoking cannabis is not often considered harmful, research has shown that inhaling cannabis smoke can negatively affect health, similar to cigarette smoke.<br />
                  <br />
                  Both cigarette and cannabis smoke contain toxins, such as ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, that may damage your lungs and increase the risk of illness <br />
                  <br />
                  Currently, some research shows a weak link between smoking cannabis and certain types of cancer, although it does not appear to be significantly associated with lung cancer<br />
                  <br />
                  Yet, scientists emphasize that it&rsquo;s unclear whether or to what extent smoking cannabis influences cancer risk, as many available studies are of low quality, and confounding variables, such as cigarette smoking, affect study results<br />
                  <br />
                  Smoking cannabis has also been associated with lung inflammation, bronchitis, and even impaired brain function<br />
                  <br />
                  In contrast, edible cannabis products have not been shown to negatively affect lung health or cancer risk.<br />
                  <br />
                  Therefore, if you&rsquo;re concerned about the possible health risks associated with smoking cannabis, you may want to use edible cannabis products as an alternative.<br />
                  <br />
                  However, because most cannabis research focuses on smoking cannabis, the long-term health implications of consuming edibles are still unknown.<br />
                  <br />
                Nevertheless, ingesting cannabis is potentially safer than smoking it. More research needs to be done to confirm this theory.</p>
