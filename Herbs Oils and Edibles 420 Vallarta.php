            <p>The form/route of administration may also play a role in the pain effects of cannabis. Medical cannabis comes in herbal (marijuana), tincture, oil, and edible forms. It can be smoked, vaporized, ingested in edible or other oral forms, taken sublingually (under the tongue), or applied topically (oil). Research on the efficacy of different routes of administration for pain is sparse. However, a 2013 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, double-blind study compared analgesic effects of smoked marijuana and dronabinol.&#8311;<br />
              <br />
              The results indicated that under controlled conditions, marijuana and dronabinol both decreased pain. However, compared with marijuana, dronabinol produced longer-lasting decreases in pain sensitivity and lower ratings of abuse-related subjective effects, which can be predictive of use and abuse patterns. Other studies suggest that smoking cannabis produces rapid effects, while oral forms take longer to work but may last longer.<br />
              <br />
              Strains of cannabis may come with names like Purple Diesel and Blue Sky. While the term &ldquo;strain&rdquo; is commonly used by dispensaries, medical cannabis users and even physicians, it&rsquo;s not a term used for plant nomenclature.&#8313; A strain name may come from a grower, producer, processor, or dispensary. A 2018 study out of Washington state found that commercial Cannabis strains fell into three broad chemotypes (chemically distinct plants that otherwise appear indistinguishable) that were defined by the THC:CBD ratio.<br />
              &ldquo;There is little consistency in plant constituents between products&rsquo; strain names,&rdquo; said David Bearman, MD, a physician in private practice who specializes in pain management and has more than 40 years of experience in managing substance abuse. &ldquo;These names are mainly marketing tools and tell little about the constituents of the product. The best advice is to read the label and understand it.&rdquo;<br />
              <br />
              Dr. Bearman is also the co-founder of the American Academy of Cannabinoid Medicine, and a board member of Americans for Safe Access &ndash; a national member-based organization of patients, medical professionals, scientists and concerned citizens promoting safe and legal access to cannabis for therapeutic use and research,and of Patients Out of Time &ndash; a Virginia-based nonprofit that works to educate all disciplines of healthcare professionals, the legal profession, and the public about medical cannabis. It's also important to know that dispensary cannabis is not regulated by the FDA so what you get in one state, or at one time, may be different from another.<br />
