                <p>Edibles are food products infused with marijuana. Though smoking marijuana is the most prevalent method of consumption, eating marijuana is quickly becoming a popular way to consume the drug.<br />
                    <br />
                Cannabis edibles are a tasty alternative to those who prefer not to inhale THC through smoking or inhaling. Cannabis edibles are food or drink products that have been infused with cannabis and provide a longer, more intense effect than other cannabis products. This option for cannabis consumption is easier for those just beginning their cannabis experience, or for those who aren&rsquo;t able to inhale due to medical conditions.<br />

                  </strong><br />
                You may feel fine for several hours after consuming a marijuana edible, then suddenly feel very high. Until you know how edibles will affect you, wait at least 2-4 hours after the first serving before consuming more.</p>
                <p><br />
                  <strong>Can edibles make you sleep?</strong><br />
                  <br />
                  Can edibles make you sleep? Absolutely! It's perfect for sleep and for those who require long-lasting effects. Plan to eat your edible at least 30 minutes before going to sleep, some people require up to two hours before it's fully absorbed and feeling the full effects.<br />
