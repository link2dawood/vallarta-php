                <h3>The Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts for Marijuana Vape Cartridges</h3>
            <p><br />
              Vape pens are one of the most popular vehicles for marijuana consumption, mostly thanks to their ease of use, simplicity and portability. Here at Sanctuary, we offer our v1 vape battery to consumers looking for a dependable, high-quality power plant for their 510 threaded vape cartridges.<br />
              <br />
              Though using it may seem as straightforward as pressing a button and taking a rip, there are some best practices that can help maximize your experience. We&rsquo;ll fill you in on what to know about your vape pen and cartridge, where issues might pop up and what you can do to both extend the shelf life of your devices and have a cleaner, smoother vaping experience.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Summary</strong><br />
              Basics: Three settings (low, medium, high) with low/medium as the recommended temps for properly enjoying Sanctuary carts<br />
              Use: Hit the button, wait half a second, inhale, release a second or two early<br />
              Hits: Take several smaller, gentler hits on low heat for the best experience and to preserve the flavor of the cart<br />
              Troubleshooting: Double-tap the battery to initiate the warming function and take several small pulls (no inhalation) to pop clogs<br />
              Battery and Cartridge Basics<br />
              <br />
              To turn on the v1, simply screw on your compatible cartridge (all Sanctuary carts work with the v1, but there are numerous other battery options), press the beaker button five times in quick succession and wait for it to illuminate. <br />
              <br />
              The v1 has three heat settings denoted by different colors&ndash; green is low, blue is medium and red is high. To adjust the heat level, press the button three times, and the color will change along with the setting. For the best flavor and oil longevity, we recommend using your v1 on low heat. If you&rsquo;re looking for larger hits, bump the setting up to medium. <br />
              <br />
              We STRONGLY advise against using the high heat setting for several reasons. The atomizer does not need to be that hot to properly vaporize cannabis oil, and increased temperatures overload the cartridge capacity while leaving your device more prone to clogging. Even if the cartridge doesn&rsquo;t back up, the oil and atomizer will become charred, diminishing the taste and the overall experience for the life of that cartridge.<br />
              <br />
              We know some of our consumers prefer the huge cloud experience, in which case we recommend dabbing some of our delightful concentrates instead. More draws at medium heat are better for the health of your cartridge, more efficient in terms of how your body absorbs cannabinoids and tastier overall. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Using the Vape<br />
              </strong>The v1 is button-fired. A press of the button engages the coil, which in turn provides power to the heating coil in the atomizer and vaporizes the cannabis oil inside. For the best experience, hit the button, wait half a second, begin your inhale and release the button a second or two before your hit ends. <br />
              <br />
              You don&rsquo;t need to press the button multiple times during a draw; the warmed, vaporized oil will be naturally drawn into the chamber once the coil is fired. If you heat the oil without drawing on the vape, you&rsquo;re charring the product and will lose flavor and vaporization in the rest of the cartridge. Releasing the button before the conclusion of your draw helps cool the atomizer and oil around it, preserving flavor and helping to prevent clogging. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Taking the Hit</strong><br />
              As for techniques, the impulse may be to take a hard pull with lots of suction to get a big hit. However, it&rsquo;s better to pretend you&rsquo;re smoking a joint or cigarette when using the vape pen because it doesn&rsquo;t require that much airflow. As previously discussed, the device is vaporizing and naturally pulling more oil into the chamber at the same time, so it doesn&rsquo;t require much enthusiasm on the draw to achieve a clean, solid-sized hit. Larger, more aggressive pulls deliver scratchier hits that are harsher on the lungs and heighten the potential for clogging. <br />
              <br />
              For the best experience, we recommend taking several smaller, gentler hits on the low heat setting rather than one monster pull. As if you were hitting a joint, draw the vapor into your mouth using your cheek muscles before inhaling into your lungs. You&rsquo;ll still be able to get a big, condensed hit because gentle draws are generally longer. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Troubleshooting Clogs</strong><br />
              All vape pens are susceptible to clogging, in particular if you are using an excessively high heat setting. Should your cartridge become backed up, there is a warming function built into the v1 device that may help get rid of the blockage. This should only be used to clear clogs; as discussed above, pre-heating the oil is unnecessary and can lead to charring and additional clogging, and it will not result in a bigger hit.<br />
              <br />
              To access the warming function, press the beaker twice in quick succession. That initiates a low-voltage current, which is sent through the atomizer to begin warming up the device. Wait three to five seconds after the double-tap before giving the pen a gentle draw. Don&rsquo;t inhale the vapors (in and out of your mouth, just like a cigar), but do several more light draws to allow the timer to run itself out over the course of 15 seconds. This should pop the clog and allow you to resume business as usual with your vape. <br />
              <br />
              More severe blockages may require a more involved fix. Often, the solution can be as simple as running a toothpick down and back up the mouthpiece opening of a cartridge to clear oil buildup in the vapor shaft. This should be performed with the cartridge at room temperature (not shortly after a hit while the inside of the cartridge is still hot).<br />
