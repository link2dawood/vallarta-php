                <h3>Alternatives to herbal cannabis                </h3>
            <p>Cannabis is available in several different forms, including:<br />
              Oil<br />
              <br />
              A popular way of consuming cannabis is through edibles.<br />
              <br />
              It is possible to extract full extract cannabis oil (FECO) from cannabis using grain alcohol or ethanol.<br />
              <br />
              People usually take FECO orally and should only need small quantities to experience benefits.<br />
              <br />
              CBD is another type of cannabis-based oil that is increasingly popular among people with chronic pain.<br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>              Topical Treatments<br />
              </strong><br />
              People can apply lotions, balms, and salves containing cannabinoids to the skin to relieve pain and inflammation. Transdermal patches that contain cannabinoids are also available and are typically more potent than lotions and salves.<br />
              Edibles<br />
              <br />
              Edibles are one of the most popular ways to use cannabis. Edibles involve infusing food, such as cookies, brownies, and candies, with the drug.<br />
              <br />
              Cannabis edibles offer an easy way to take cannabis, but the effects of edibles can be difficult to predict.<br />
              <br />
              Sublingual administration involves placing a drug under the tongue. The drug enters the bloodstream faster using this method and so it will work more quickly.<br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Cannabis vs. opioids for pain relief</strong><br />
              Opioids are powerful medications that relieve pain by acting on the nervous system. They are highly addictive, and withdrawal symptoms are not uncommon.<br />
              <br />
              In 2016, approximately 116 people died every day in the U.S. from opioid-related drug overdoses, and 11.5 million people misuse prescription opioids every year.<br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Is cannabis better than opioids?<br />
              </strong>Medical cannabis may offer an alternative to addictive opioids. When researchers surveyed almost 3,000 medical cannabis users, they found that 30 percent had used opioids in the last 6 months.<br />
              <br />
              Of those respondents, 81 percent agreed or strongly agreed that cannabis was more effective alone than in combination with opioids.<br />
              <br />
              In addition, 97 percent said they agreed or strongly agreed that they could decrease their opioid usage when taking cannabis.<br />
