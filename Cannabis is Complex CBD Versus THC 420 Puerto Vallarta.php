                <h3>Cannabis is Complex: CBD Versus THC
            </h3>
            <p>The chemical complexity of cannabis itself has made it difficult for researchers to untangle its effects on pain and, at the same time, difficult for clinicians and patients to find the most effective species and route of administration. Cannabis is the genus name for a disputed number of plant species. The two most widely accepted species are Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica, though hybrid species are also common.<br />
              <br />
              Chemically speaking, cannabis is complicated. To date, 568 unique molecules have been identified in the cannabis; of these, more than 60 are cannabinoids &mdash; these are compounds that act on receptors in the body&rsquo;s endocannabinoid sy stem. This system plays a key role in endogenous pain control.<br />
              <br />
              Two of the cannabinoids found in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), along with other cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoid compounds, are thought to exhibit synergistic effects that promote pain relief.&#8309; THC is the most psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis and is primarily responsible for the &ldquo;high&rdquo; associated with marijuana. It can also reduce nausea and increase appetite. CBD does not provide the euphoria associated with THC and is associated with reduced pain and inflammation.<br />
