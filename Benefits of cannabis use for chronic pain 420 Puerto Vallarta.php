                <h3>Benefits of cannabis use for chronic pain</h3>
            <p>According to some research, it is as effective as opioids, which are among the most potent pain-relieving drugs.<br />
              <br />
              The side effects of cannabis use are usually minimal, especially in comparison with opioid side effects. However, due to lack of regulation for most cannabis-based therapies, the exact composition and quality of a product cannot be guaranteed.<br />
              <br />
              This evidence indicates that cannabis may be beneficial for chronic pain relief.<br />
              <br />
              There are several strains of cannabis available, so even if one strain does not reduce symptoms, another may. Typically, it is best for people to keep their dosage low, especially if they are new to using cannabis.<br />
              <br />
              Those who wish to use medical cannabis should discuss the risks and benefits in more detail with their doctor and ensure they obtain their medications legally and from a reputable outlet.<br />

              <strong>Does marijuana help get rid of pain?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Medical Marijuana<br />
                </strong><br />
                  It doesn't work like a typical painkiller. Instead of getting rid of your hurt, it tricks your brain into believing that it's not so bad. Studies show pot may treat some symptoms of multiple sclerosis. It may also help you sleep better if you have long-term pain.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>What is the best CBD strain for pain?<br />
                  </strong>Harlequin. Perhaps the most popular high-CBD strain in North America, Harlequin treats anxiety, chronic pain, inflammation, PMS and cramps, among others. It's often described as bringing clear-headed and uplifting effects.<br />
                      <strong><br />
                  Is CBD an anti inflammatory?</strong><br />
                  Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the main pharmacologically active phytocannabinoids of Cannabis sativa L. CBD is non-psychoactive but exerts a number of beneficial pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Does CBD help with joint pain?<br />
                  </strong>A 2017 study found that CBD might be a safe and useful treatment option for joint pain associated with osteoarthritis. A 2016 study found that the topical application of CBD had the potential to relieve pain and inflammation associated with arthritis.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>                  Do CBD gummies work for pain?<br />
                  </strong>Research indicates that CBD products may help relieve anxiety, pain, and depression. CBD products that contain less than 0.3% THC are legal on a federal level. People do not need a prescription to buy CBD gummies.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How long does it take for CBD oil to work for joint pain?<br />
                  </strong>You should feel the effects within 30 minutes. Try using a balm or lotion if you are looking for relief from physical pain. It may help with soreness from inflamed muscles or relieve painful arthritic joints. CBD oil is applied directly to the affected area but may take several hours over the day to work fully.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How many drops CBD oil for arthritis?<br />
                  </strong>Start with just a few milligrams of CBD in sublingual form twice a day. If relief is inadequate after one week, increase the dose by that same amount. If needed, go up in small increments over several weeks. If you find relief, continue taking that dose twice daily to maintain a stable level of CBD in the blood.<br />
