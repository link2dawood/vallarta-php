                <p>Vape cartridges are small containers, outfitted with a heating element and a mouthpiece, filled with cannabis concentrate. The extract inside contains much higher levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD) than ground flower, so you'll likely need to consume less for your desired effect.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>What is the difference between vape and cartridges?</strong><br />
                  It's simple. The cartridge (or dab cart) is the top part of the vape pen that is a chamber that contains the cannabis oil and a mouthpiece that you'll use to inhale. The bottom part of a vape pen is called the battery. The two parts screw together (it's known as a 510 thread).<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How many puffs does a cartridge last?</strong><br />
                  The average person inhales about 3-5 mg of vapor per puff or about 1 mg of e-liquid per second. Some people may prefer longer, less frequent draws on their vape pen for more potent hits. Depending on the size of your vape cartridge, you can expect about 130-140 puffs in a 500 mg cartridge before it's emptied.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Can a cart get you high?</strong><br />
                  Cannabis tolerance happens when your body becomes used to a substance and then you need more of it to get the same effect. Generally, it could be the potency of what's in the cartridge. Most carts average 80mgs of THC<br />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How does vaping make you feel?</strong><br />
                  <br />
                  It causes your body to release adrenaline, a hormone that raises your pulse, blood pressure, and breathing rate. This could play a role in raising your heart attack odds. You may also feel more alert and need to cough. If you vape marijuana, the high will be stronger than if you smoke the same amount.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Is vaping worse than smoking?</strong><br />
                  1: Vaping is less harmful than smoking, but it's still not safe. E-cigarettes heat nicotine (extracted from tobacco), flavorings and other chemicals to create an aerosol that you inhale. Regular tobacco cigarettes contain 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic.<br />
                  Will vaping CBD show up in a drug test?<br />
                If you know that you're going to be tested and you vape cannabidiol oil, although CBD does not show up on drug tests, you're still at risk of testing positive for THC [or even a false positive, as that's very common].</p>
