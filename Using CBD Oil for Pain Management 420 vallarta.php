                <h3>Using CBD Oil for Pain Management: Does It Work?                </h3>
            <p>Overview<br />
              Cannabidiol (CBD) is a type of cannabinoid, a chemical found naturally in cannabis (marijuana and hemp) plants. CBD doesn&rsquo;t cause the &ldquo;high&rdquo; feeling often associated with cannabis. That feeling is caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a different type of cannabinoid.<br />
              <br />
              Some people with chronic pain use topical CBD products, in particular CBD oil, to manage their symptoms. CBD oil may reduce:<br />
              pain<br />
              inflammation<br />
              overall discomfort related to a variety of health conditions<br />
              <br />
              The research on CBD products and pain management has been promising.<br />
              <br />
              CBD can offer an alternative for people who have chronic pain and rely on medications, such as opioids, that can be habit-forming and cause more side effects. However, more research is needed to verify the pain-relieving benefits of CBD oil and other products.<br />
              <br />
              Epidiolex, a drug prescribed for epilepsy, is the only CBD product on the market that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved.<br />
              <br />
              There aren&rsquo;t any FDA-approved, nonprescription CBD products. They aren&rsquo;t regulated for purity and dosage like other medications.<br />
              <br />
              Keep reading to learn more about the potential benefits of CBD use for pain. You can also talk with your doctor to see if it&rsquo;s an option for your condition.<br />
