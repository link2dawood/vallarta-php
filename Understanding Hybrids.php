                <h3><strong>Understanding Hybrids</strong></h3>
            <p><br />
            Hybrids are simply new and unique strains that are bred from parents of different types. A hybrid theoretically possesses many or most of the beneficial medical properties of both its parents. Breeders can &ldquo;cross&rdquo; any two strains they desire in an effort to create a new strain that delivers the best possible medical efficacy, sometimes for particular diseases like lupus, multiple sclerosis, Crohn&rsquo;s disease, and epilepsy.<br />
              <br />
              It should be noted that any two strains can be mixed to create a hybrid. While indica/sativa mixes are common and often noted for their &ldquo;alert mellowness&rdquo; and productivity, medical cannabis breeders can also mix indicas with other indicas or use two sativas as parents.<br />
              With so many hybrid strains available to patients, many are a compromise that possess the ability to kill pain and fight inflammation while not putting a patient to sleep in the middle of the day. Patients who must medicate in the morning or mid-day, typically for nausea and pain, often prefer a sativa-dominant hybrid, but will switch to an indica-dom strain in the evenings and for maximum pain relief.<br />
              <br />
              Hybrid strains that display more indica than sativa traits are labeled &ldquo;indica-dom,&rdquo; while those that lean toward sativa are similarly dubbed &ldquo;sativa-dom.&rdquo; Often, strains are labeled with a sativa/indica ratio, like a 60/40 sativa/indica. Other times a strain will indicate only a percentage, such as &ldquo;70 percent indica&rdquo; or &ldquo;80 percent sativa&rdquo;.<br />
