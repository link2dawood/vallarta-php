                <h3>Best cannabis strains for chronic pain</h3>
            <p>Cannabis may help relieve certain types of chronic pain.</p>
                <p>The different types of cannabis plants include the following:<br />
                  Cannabis indica<br />
                  Cannabis sativa<br />
                  Hybrids</p>
<p>There is limited research available on the use of specific cannabis strains for pain and other symptoms. As a result, strain-specific recommendations are not medically proven.<br />
                  <br />
                  The results of an online survey, comprising 95 participants, featured in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in 2014.<br />
          <br />
          The researchers found that participants preferred indica strains for pain management, sedation, and sleep while they would opt for sativa strains to improve energy and mood.</p>
                <p>Regarding pain management, participants reported a statistically significant effect when using indica for:<br />
                  non-migraine headaches<br />
                  neuropathy<br />
                  spasticity<br />
                  joint pain</p>
                <p>It is, however, important to note that this study had several limitations. It was small in scale, anonymous, and asked people to self-report on their symptoms. Respondents did not use the cannabis in a controlled setting, potentially resulting in differences in drug composition, dosage, and potency.<br />
                  <br />
                  Another study examined the use of organically grown sativa and indica strains in the treatment of several medical conditions. Just over half of the participants were using cannabis to treat HIV.<br />
                  <br />
            The study followed participants for 3 years and asked them about the effects of the drug on their condition during this time. The results indicated that indica strains are more likely to improve energy and appetite, while both sativa and indica strains can alleviate nausea to a similar degree.</p>
