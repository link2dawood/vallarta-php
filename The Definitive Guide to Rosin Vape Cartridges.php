            <p><br />
              Vaping is all the rage - sound like a cliche? Well, turns out, it's true based on data coming from MJBiz, Headset, ArcView, and more. Consumers list its high potency and discretion as two of many reasons why they choose vapes. Going off sales data, it appears that the public isn&rsquo;t slowing down on their fondness for them either. <br />
              <br />
              Vaping extends beyond THC. CBD-specific carts are quite common. As are cartridges containing a ratio of THC and CBD. One of the more common combos is a 1:1 THC to CBD pen that gives consumers the high of THC while applying the offsetting effects of CBD. <br />
              <br />
              For rosin cartridges however, they are all typically THC-dominant due to the strains being produced and extracted from with solventless methods.<br />
              <br />
              For the most part however, cartridges have been produced with solvents. Even as solventless options began to rise, many products were made with substandard source material and practices. Rosin vape cartridge oil has represented a change in that path. The solventless, potent products are excellent for those seeking a strong concentrate that provides a natural taste and aroma to the experience. <br />

              Let&rsquo;s take a look at rosin vape cartridge oil, the option that is helping cut into the market&rsquo;s inferior products.<br />
