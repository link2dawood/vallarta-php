            Edibles typically take around 30 to 60 minutes to kick in. However, onset time depends on a lot of factors.<br />
              <br />
  First, it depends on the product&rsquo;s active ingredients. If the product contains a high dose or concentration of THC, it could take effect faster.<br />
  <br />
  Keep in mind that CBD-only edibles are not psychoactive. They don&rsquo;t cause the &ldquo;high&rdquo; typically associated with THC-infused edibles. As a result, it may be harder to identify when CBD products have taken effect.<br />
  <br />
                  For both types of products, onset time also depends on where in the body the edibles are being broken down and absorbed into the bloodstream.<br />
                  <br />
                  Lozenges, gum, and lollipops kick in faster because they&rsquo;re absorbed sublingually<br />
                  <br />
                  Some edible products, such as lozenges, gum, and lollipops, are ingested but not actually swallowed. In these cases, absorption occurs through the mucus membranes of the mouth. This is called sublingual absorption, and the effects are more likely to appear faster.<br />
                  <br />
                  Chewable edibles take longer to kick in because they&rsquo;re absorbed through the digestive system<br />
                  <br />
                  Chewable edibles, such as gummies, cookies, and brownies, may have longer onset times. This is because absorption first occurs in the digestive tract. From there, active ingredients enter the bloodstream and travel to the liver.<br />
                  <br />
                  In the liver, active ingredients are metabolized before they are released back into the bloodstream and enter the brain, at which point the effects appear.<br />
                  <br />
                  Other factors affecting onset time<br />
                  <br />
                  Other factors that can affect how quickly you start to feel the effects of ingested edibles are related to your habits and physical makeup. <br />
                  <br />
                  They include your:<br />
                  diet<br />
                  metabolism<br />
                  sex<br />
                  weight<br />
                  tolerance to cannabis<br />
                  <br />
                  Since edibles don&rsquo;t kick in right away, it can be tempting to take more soon after your first dose. This can lead to taking too much.<br />
                  You should always wait at least 24 hours before taking another dose.<br />
