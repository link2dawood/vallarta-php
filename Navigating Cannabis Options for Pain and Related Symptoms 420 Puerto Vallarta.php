              <br />
              A growing body of clinical research and a history of anecdotal evidence support the use of cannabis for the relief of some types of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, and spasticity (ie, stiffness or tightness) associated with multiple sclerosis.&sup1; In a recent comprehensive review of existing data on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids, the National Academies of Science concluded that adult patients with chronic pain who were treated with cannabis/cannabinoids were more likely to experience a clinically significant reduction in pain symptoms.&sup2; They rated these effects as &ldquo;modest.&rdquo;<br />
              <br />
              Studies also suggest some efficacy for cancer-related pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia, and other pain conditions.&sup3; However, how different species, routes of administration, and doses differ in their effect is less clear, and more research is needed.<br />
