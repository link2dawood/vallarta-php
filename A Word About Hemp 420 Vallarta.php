                <h3>A Word About Hemp </h3>
            <p>Hemp products &mdash; including oils, extracts, and even &ldquo;gummies&rdquo; &mdash; aimed at relieving pain and anxiety abound on the internet. But what is hemp and how does it differ from marijuana? The conventional answer is that hemp and marijuana are two different species of the Cannabis genus of plants.<br />
              <br />
              Hemp, which is primarily used for industrial purposes (particularly fiber products), is considered to be the Cannabis sativa species; marijuana (used for medicinal and recreational purposes) is considered to be the Cannabis indica species. The two species differ not only in appearance but also in levels of THC and CBD.<br />
              <br />
              C. sativa is associated with higher levels of THC while C. indica is associated with higher levels of CBD. The science is more complicated. A 2015 study&sup1;&sup1; of genetic structures of marijuana and hemp suggests that &ldquo;C. sativa and C. indica may represent distinguishable pools of genetic diversity but that breeding has resulted in considerable admixture between the two.&rdquo; Researchers also found that hemp has more in common genetically with C. indica than with C. sativa. Differences in THC production held true.<br />
