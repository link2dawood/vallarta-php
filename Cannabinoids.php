                <h3><strong>Cannabinoids</strong></h3>
            <p><br />
              Cannabis plants contain dozens of chemical compounds called cannabinoids.<br />
              <br />
              <br />
              These naturally occurring components are responsible for producing many of the effects &mdash; both negative and positive &mdash; of cannabis use. Researchers still don&rsquo;t understand what all of the cannabinoids do, but they have identified two main ones &mdash; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) &mdash; as well as several less common compounds.<br />
              <br />
              These include:<br />
              THC. THC is the main psychoactive compound in cannabis plants. It&rsquo;s responsible for the &ldquo;high&rdquo; or state of euphoria associated with cannabis use. Levels of THC have been increasing as growers try to create hybrids with a greater concentration of the compound.<br />
              <br />
              CBD. CBD is non-impairing or non-euphoric. It doesn&rsquo;t cause a &ldquo;high.&rdquo; However, it may produce many physical benefits, such as reducing pain and nausea, preventing seizures, and easing migraine.<br />
              <br />
              CBN. Cannabinol (CBN) is used to ease symptoms and side effects of neurological conditions, including epilepsy, seizures, and uncontrollable muscle stiffness.<br />
              <br />
              THCA. Tetrahydrocannabinol acid (THCA) is similar to THC, but it doesn&rsquo;t cause any psychoactive effects. Its potential benefits include reducing inflammation caused by arthritis and autoimmune diseases. It may also help reduce symptoms of neurological conditions like Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and ALS.<br />
              <br />
              CBG. Cannabigerol (CBG) is thought to help reduce anxiety and symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression.<br />
              <br />
              Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two of the most studied and discussed elements, or cannabinoids, present in different strains of marijuana. However, researchers have identified at least 144 different cannabinoids so far.<br />
              THC and CBD have very different effects on the human body. Knowing whether a cannabis plant is from the indica or sativa strain does not always provide much information about the relative amounts of THC or CBD it may contain, as people tend to believe, but it can be helpful.<br />
              <br />
              It is also important to note that THC and CBD are only two of the hundreds of chemicals that create the varying effects of different strains of marijuana. The sections below provide more information on these two chemicals.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>THC</strong><br />
              Medical experts say that THC has psychoactive properties. In other words, THC is what produces the &ldquo;high&rdquo; effect that people tend to associate with using cannabis.<br />
              Strains of marijuana with a high THC content may be helpful for people with pain, difficulty sleeping, and depression, though they can make some people anxious.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>CBD</strong><br />
              CBD does not create a &ldquo;high,&rdquo; but it can affect mood and be helpful in addressing anxiety and psychoses. However, despite its reputation for inducing calm, CBD can be a stimulant in small and monitored doses.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Indica</strong><br />
              The Cannabis indica plant originated in the Middle East, in places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tibet.<br />
              It generally has a higher CBD content than Cannabis sativa, though the CBD to THC ratio is very close to 1:1<br />
              The general perception is that indica is an effective pain reliever, with a flat and relaxing high. Many medical marijuana strains contain a hybrid form of this strain.<br />
              That said, it is important to note that little scientific evidence backs these ideas. There are far more variations within the indica vs. sativa categorization, and many scientists believe<br />
that we should not generalize the psychoactive and other effects of different strains.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sativa</strong><br />
Cannabis sativa comes from warmer parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia and Central and South America.<br />
The general perception is that it provides a more energizing and creative high, though it can prompt anxiety in some people. Sativa can also be helpful for people with depression, headaches, nausea, and appetite loss. Sativa plants tend to contain more THC than CBD.<br />
Again, it is important to note that some scientific research negates these claims. Some sativa plants may be energizing while others may not. The same goes for indica strains.<br />
<br />
<strong>Hybrids</strong><br />
Both growers and nature have created hybrid forms of both Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica throughout the long history of humans&rsquo; use of cannabis.<br />
People bred hybrids, for example, to make plants that grow more quickly, improve yield, and balance out the energizing and calming effects.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ruderalis</strong><br />
Cannabis ruderalis has its origins in cooler parts of the world, such as Russia and the border between Hungary and Ukraine. It grows wild, and some speculate that it may descend from escaped hemp plants.<br />
It does not have very high levels of THC or CBD, but breeders value it for its ability to flower by itself, without assistance from a cultivator. This is why people frequently use ruderalis to create hybrids with sativa or indica.<br />
