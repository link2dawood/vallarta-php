                <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9da63f87-7fff-9bae-f165-e5d39b947b29">What's the difference between indica and sativa?</strong><br />
                  As marijuana use for both medical and recreational purposes becomes legal in more and more states, there is a growing interest in the different effects that various types, including indica and sativa, can produce.<br />
                  <br />
                  Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica are two species of cannabis. This means that they share many similar features but have specific and distinct differences.<br />
                  <br />
                  Although anecdotal evidence and some marijuana dispensaries claim that indica is more calming and sativa is more energizing, some experts
                  say that such statements are misleading. Many more factors are involved in creating the recreational and medical effects of marijuana than strain alone.<br />
                  <br />
In this article, learn more about the differences between each strain, as well as the effects that indica and sativa can produce.<br />
<br />
<strong>Physical differences between strains</strong><br />
                  <br />
                  Botanists use physical differences &mdash; such as variations in height, branching patterns, and the shape of the leaves &mdash; to identify different strains of plants. This is where the names &ldquo;indica&rdquo; and &ldquo;sativa&rdquo; come from. Indica plants are shorter than sativa plants, and they have a woody stalk, not a fibrous one. Indica plants also grow more quickly than sativa plants. There is some disagreement regarding what caused these physical differences between strains. Some researchers
                  say that these differences are due to humans breeding different varieties, while others say that a mixture of evolving adaptations and geographic isolation is responsible.<br />
