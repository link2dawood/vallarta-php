                <h3>420 Marijuana Cannabis Hybrid Strain </h3>
            <p>The side effects of a hybrid strain include a boost in energy followed by a feeling of being tired as well as euphoria and temporary happiness. The chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant are known as cannabinoids and terpenes and are the reason behind why you feel the effects of marijuana.<br />

                <strong>What does it mean when a strain is hybrid?</strong><br />
              Hybrid cannabis strains are created by crossing a Sativa and an Indica together. Sometimes, hybrids are formed from three or more different strains. Sometimes a hybrid cannabis strain will be Indica-dominant or Sativa-dominant. Other times, it can be an almost even combination of the two.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Is hybrid a upper or downer?</strong><br />
              Hybrid strains can be both upper and downer depending on which species is dominant. The Indica vs. Sativa high has different effects. For instance, Sativa is more likely to increase anxiety.<br />

              <strong>What type of high do you get from hybrid?</strong><br />
              A sativa-dominant hybrid is a strain that has more effects from sativa than those of indica. This means you'll feel the uplifting and euphoric feelings of a sativa, while still get enough of a body high to ensure you are not overwhelmed.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>What's the difference between hybrid and Sativa?</strong></p>
            <p>The buds of a Sativa plant are typically less dense and can be somewhat feathery. Sativa strains usually produce a cerebral feeling and are more uplifting and euphoric. As a result, they are recommended for daytime use. A hybrid is a Cannabis plant that is a crossbreed between an Indica and a Sativa plant.</p>
