                <h3>When Did People Start Smoking 420 Marijuana?</h3>
            <p>It&rsquo;s unclear how long humans have used Marijuana as a drug, but archaeologists have discovered tools used to burn Psychoactive Marijuana dating back 2,500 years in China. The Chinese Emperor Shen Nung created the first written record of Marijuana use in the year 2727 BC, almost 5,000 years ago. Because of the speed of its growth and the use of hemp for rope and cloth, Marijuana saw use throughout many ancient societies lasting through to the present day. Even though humans have been smoking Marijuana for thousands of years, its effects on the body are still being discovered. As it becomes more legal and more available, knowing those effects has become more important.<br />

                <strong>Medical marijuana<br />
              </strong>U.S. federal law prohibits the use of marijuana. However, many states allow medical use to treat pain, nausea and other symptoms.<br />

              Medical marijuana is a term for derivatives of the Cannabis sativa plant that are used to ease symptoms caused by certain medical conditions. Medical marijuana is also known as medical cannabis.<br />
              Cannabis sativa contains many active compounds. The best known are delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the primary ingredient in marijuana that makes people &quot;high.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              <strong>              Is medical marijuana legal in the U.S.?<br />
              </strong>U.S. federal law prohibits the use of whole plant Cannabis sativa or its derivatives for any purpose. In contrast, CBD derived from the hemp plant (less than 0.3% THC) is legal under federal law.<br />
            Many states allow THC to be used for medical reasons. Federal law regulating marijuana supersedes state laws. Because of this, people may be arrested and charged with possession even in states where marijuana use is legal.<br />
