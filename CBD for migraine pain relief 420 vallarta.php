                <h3>CBD for migraine pain relief</h3>
            <p>Studies on CBD and migraine are limited. The studies that currently exist also look at CBD when it&rsquo;s paired with THC, not when it&rsquo;s used alone.<br />
              <br />
              However, results from a 2017 study indicate that CBD and THC can lead to less acute pain and less intense pain for people with migraine.<br />
              <br />
              In this two-phase study, some participants took a combination of two compounds. One compound contained 9 percent CBD and almost no THC. The other compound contained 19 percent THC. Doses were taken orally.<br />
              <br />
              In phase I, there was no effect on pain when the doses were under 100 mg. When the doses were increased to 200 mg, acute pain fell by 55 percent.<br />
              <br />
              In phase II, participants who received the combination of CBD and THC compounds saw the frequency of their migraine attacks fall by 40.4 percent. The daily dose was 200 mg.<br />
              <br />
              The combination of compounds was slightly more effective than 25 mg of amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant. Amitriptyline reduced migraine attacks by 40.1 percent in study participants.<br />
              <br />
              Participants with cluster headaches also found pain relief with the combination of CBD and THC compounds, but only if they&rsquo;d had a childhood history of migraine.<br />
