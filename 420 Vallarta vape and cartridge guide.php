                <h3> Vape &amp; Cartridge </h3>
                <p>Is a cartridge the same as a vape?<br />
                  <br />
                  No !<br />
                  It's simple.&nbsp;The cartridge (or dab cart) is the top part of the vape pen&nbsp;that is a chamber that contains the cannabis oil and a mouthpiece that you'll use to inhale. The bottom part of a vape pen is called the battery. The two parts screw together (it's known as a 510 thread). A cartridge can be unattached from a batttery and replaced while a disposable vape chamber which contains the cannabis oil is not removable, so once a vape chamber has expired the vape including the battery are disposed. <br />
                  <br />
                  Because the oil in both Disposables and Carts are the same, the potency is going to be the same. What can make the experiences differ, however, is that Cartridges tend to have a smoother, more consistent draw, whereas Disposable vape pens hits can be inconsistent, especially as the battery drains although vapes are much smaller and can easily fit in the palm of your hand.<br />
                  <br />
                  Both disposables and cartridges are all about making your vape experience as smooth as silk. Disposables are the ultimate in convenience &ndash; no upkeep, no mess, just puff and go. Cartridges step it up with their reusable nature, allowing for easy swaps and a consistent device you can get to know and love. <br />

                Understanding THC Vapes &amp; Cartridges <br />
                Vaping involves inhaling a vapour created by heating a specific liquid substance. In the world of THC, these liquids are known as vape oils or e-liquids, containing varying concentrations of cannabinoids.

                What is a THC Vape Pen? <br />
A THC vape pen is a portable vaporizer specifically designed for inhaling THC vape  liquid.<br />
It typically consists of a battery, a heating element (aka, an atomizer), and a cartridge containing the liquid itself.<br />
When you activate the pen, the battery heats the atomizer, thus vaporising the liquid for inhalation.<br />
