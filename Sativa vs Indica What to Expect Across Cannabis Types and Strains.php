                <h3>Sativa vs. Indica: What to Expect Across Cannabis Types and Strains</h3>
            <p><br />
              The two main types of cannabis, sativa and indica, are used for a number of medicinal and recreational purposes.<br />
              <br />
              Sativas are known for their &ldquo;head high,&rdquo; an invigorating, energizing effect that can help reduce anxiety or stress and increase creativity and focus.<br />
              <br />
              Indicas are typically associated with full-body effects, such as increasing deep relaxation and reducing insomnia.<br />
              <br />
              Although research examining these effects is limited, it appears these plants have more in common than previously thought.<br />
              <br />
              Many in the cannabis industry have moved away from the terms Indica, Sativa and hybrid and started classifying the different &ldquo;strains&rdquo; or, more correctly, &ldquo;chemovars&rdquo; as:<br />
              Type I: high THC<br />
              Type II: THC/CBD combined<br />
              Type III: high CBD<br />
              <br />
              More and more, the cannabis industry is moving away from the term &ldquo;strains&rdquo; and using chemovars (chemical varieties) instead, since the word &ldquo;strain&rdquo; is often used to refer to bacteria and viruses. In other words, the category, or type, of cannabis may not be the greatest indicator of the effects you&rsquo;ll experience.<br />
