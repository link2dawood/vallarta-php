                <h3>How does cannabis work for pain?                </h3>
            <p>Cannabis contains compounds that may relieve pain, nausea, and other symptoms. The components of cannabis that most studies focus on for pain relief are cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).<br />
              <br />
                <strong>THC vs. CBD<br />
              </strong>THC resembles the cannabinoid chemicals that occur naturally in the body. When people ingest or inhale THC, it stimulates the brain&rsquo;s cannabinoid receptors.<br />
                  <br />
              This activates the brain&rsquo;s reward system and reduces pain levels. THC is a psychoactive compound as it binds to cannabinoid receptors and produces an elevated state of mind, known as a high.<br />
              <br />
              CBD does not cause a high, although it does interact with pain receptors in the brain to exert pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>What the research says<br />
              </strong><br />
              In recent years, many studies have looked at the effects of cannabis for chronic pain. Some studies used parts of the cannabis plant and some have used the entire plant so more research is needed. Using parts of the cannabis plant (like CBD oil) helps study specific actions of that ingredient, but when the whole plant is used there is what is called an entourage effect, where the parts work together to have more effect.<br />
              <br />
              A 2015 review of research on the use of cannabis and cannabinoids for various chronic pain conditions reports that several trials had positive results. The researchers suggest that cannabis or cannabinoids may be effective for treating some types of chronic pain including neuropathy (nerve pain).<br />
              <br />
              A research paper from 2016 found that cannabis use for cancer pain led to a 64-percent reduction in opioid use, improved quality of life, and caused fewer medication side effects. It also led to participants using fewer medications.<br />
              <br />
              Smaller studies have reported benefits for other types of chronic pain. For example:<br />
              <br />
              Of about 17,000 people with cancer, 70 percent reportedly experienced an improvement in pain and general well-being after cannabis use.<br />
              <br />
              People with chronic migraines experienced a decrease in migraine episodes after using the drug.<br />
              <br />
              However, there is still a need for more research into the area of cannabis use for chronic pain, especially into the use of different strains, dosages, and methods of delivery.<br />
              <br />
              An Australian study, published in July 2018, concluded that cannabis use did not reduce the symptoms of pain or the need to use opioid medications. However, the findings were mostly based on reports from people who used the drug recreationally.<br />
              <br />
              Using cannabis specifically for medicinal purposes might yield different results.<br />
