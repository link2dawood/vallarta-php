                <p>Cannabis has many potential medicinal benefits and has been used to treat various ailments throughout history.<br />
                  Today, edible cannabis product usage among patients is becoming increasingly popular, and polls consistently show most healthcare professionals believe that cannabis should be a medical option for patients.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>May benefit certain health conditions<br />
                  </strong><br />
                  Edible cannabis products are often used to treat conditions, such as:<br />
                  chronic pain<br />
                  cancer-related symptoms<br />
            anxiety</p>
                <p>Medical cannabis products can legally be prescribed in countries around the world, including Italy, Spain, and Germany, and &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; by physicians in dozens of U.S. states that have legalized cannabis<br />
                  <br />
                  THC is one of over 100 unique compounds &mdash; known as cannabinoids &mdash; in cannabis.<br />
                  <br />
                  THC is the compound responsible for the intoxicating properties of cannabis products, including edibles, that may induce feelings of euphoria and relaxation<br />
                  <br />
                  THC is also believed to be the primary compound responsible for the pain-relieving effects of cannabis.<br />
                  <br />
                  Other compounds in cannabis, such as CBD, are non-intoxicating and have been shown to have anxiety-reducing or anti-inflammatory properties.<br />
                  <br />
            Edible cannabis products, such as oils, tinctures, pills, and gummies, are commonly used to treat poor appetite, pain, and weight loss in people who have cancer </p>
                <p>Additionally, these products may reduce pain and muscle spasms, relieve nausea and vomiting, enhance sleep quality, and improve anxiety<br />
                  <br />
                  In fact, pharmaceutical companies manufacture oral preparations of cannabis-derived treatments, such as Sativex, which is an oral spray that contains equal amounts of THC and CBD prescribed to treat pain and muscle spasticity<br />
                  <br />
                  Though edible cannabis products are commonly used to treat many other ailments, such as digestive and neurological disorders, high quality research in these areas is lacking.<br />
                  <br />
                  Therefore, the full therapeutic potential of cannabis is still unknown</p>
