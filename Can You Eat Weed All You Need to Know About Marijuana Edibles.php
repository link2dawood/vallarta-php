                <p>Cannabis &mdash; colloquially sometimes called marijuana or weed &mdash; refers to the dried flowers, seeds, stems, and leaves of the Cannabis sativa L species of plants<br />
                  <br />
                  It&rsquo;s a popular substance millions of people use either for pleasure or to treat chronic health conditions. Cannabis can be used in a number of ways, but some of the most popular methods include smoking, vaping, and eating (sometimes known as &ldquo;edibles&rdquo;).<br />
                  <br />
                  However, some people wonder whether it&rsquo;s safe to eat cannabis-containing products and whether ingesting it has the same effects as smoking or vaping.<br />
                  This article explains whether it&rsquo;s safe to eat cannabis products and the health effects &mdash; both positive and negative &mdash; related to ingestion.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Can you eat marijuana?<br />
                  </strong><br />
                  The short answer is yes; you can eat cannabis. In fact, cannabis-infused foods or drinks have been consumed throughout history, as far back as 1000 B.C.<br />
                  <br />
                  Cannabis was used as medicine in ancient China and India and was introduced to Western medicine in the early 19th century. Edible applications, such as tinctures, were prescribed to treat various conditions, from chronic pain to digestive disorders <br />
                  Edible cannabis products were also used to relieve stress and induce euphoria, similar to alcohol.<br />
                  <br />
                  Bhang, a beverage made from a mixture of the leaves and flowers of cannabis plants, has been consumed for centuries during religious festivals, such as Holi, a Hindu festival of love and color In the United States, recreational use of edible cannabis products became popular during the 1960s, and today, many different types of edibles are available, both legally and illegally, depending on state laws.<br />
                  <br />
                  For example, gummies, candies, chocolates, capsules, teas, and oils are some of the edible cannabis products sold in both legal cannabis dispensaries and through the illegal cannabis market.<br />
                  Edibles enthusiasts also make their own cannabis products by infusing butter or oil with cannabis and mixing it into baked goods and other recipes.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Raw Cannabis</strong><br />
                  <br />
                  Though you can eat raw cannabis, it won&rsquo;t have the same effect as consuming cannabis-based products, as it has to go through a process known as decarboxylation to become activated <br />
            Raw cannabis contains tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), compounds that must be exposed to heat, such as in smoking or baking, to turn into the active forms, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)</p>
                <p>Therefore, eating raw cannabis will not result in the same effects as consuming cannabis that has been heated, as in edible products like candies, tinctures, and baked goods.<br />
                  <br />
                  Though you can&rsquo;t get high from eating raw cannabis, some cannabis proponents believe that eating it may offer unique health benefits due to the wide array of plant compounds it contains.<br />
                  <br />
            Yet, research in this area is lacking, so the potential therapeutic benefit of raw cannabis is still unclear.</p>
