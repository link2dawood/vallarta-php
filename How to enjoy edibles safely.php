                <p>Many people enjoy using cannabis products to relax and ease stress, while some take edibles to treat or improve symptoms of a medical condition.<br />
                  <br />
                  Either way, it&rsquo;s important to use safe products and choose appropriate dosages to avoid unwanted side effects. If you&rsquo;re interested in using edibles to treat a medical condition, talk with your doctor to learn if medical marijuana is an option.<br />
                Depending on where you live, you might be able to get a physician&rsquo;s &ldquo;recommendation.&rdquo; In the United States, 36 states allow the use of medical marijuana. It has also been legalized in countries around the world, including Canada and many European countries (20, 21).</p>
                <p>Some conditions that may warrant a medical marijuana physician&rsquo;s recommendation include:<br />
                  chronic pain<br />
                  anxiety<br />
                  multiple sclerosis<br />
                  terminal illness<br />
                  inflammatory bowel disease</p>
                <p>In contrast, recreational use of cannabis is illegal in many parts of the world, including many parts of the United States. As of 2021, 16 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia currently allow for the use of recreational cannabis products .However, even though cannabis is legal to use in many U.S. states, it remains illegal at a federal level and is considered a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), alongside drugs like heroin.<br />
                  <br />
                  According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Schedule I substances are &ldquo;determined to have a high potential for abuse&rdquo; and are defined as having &ldquo;no currently accepted medical use&rdquo;). Yet, many disagree with this classification, especially those who have seen firsthand that cannabis products offer medicinal and therapeutic benefits for many people.<br />
                  <br />
                  In fact, scientists have repeatedly questioned this classification which prevents research on real world cannabis and only allows U.S. scientists to study cannabis that the federal government grows in Mississippi. Some argue that the current legal status is outdated and &ldquo;thwarts legitimate research&rdquo; exploring the potential of cannabis use in the medical field, Though both social and political views on cannabis are changing rapidly, for now, citizens must abide by the laws set forth by state and federal governments for the use of both medical and recreational cannabis.</p>
