                <h3>How Is It Different From Indica or Sativa?</h3>
                <p>While we have been using indica, sativa, and hybrid classifications in the cannabis industry for a long time, we&rsquo;ve come to realize that it&rsquo;s actually not correct. This is because on a molecular level, indica and sativa are all part of the Cannabis sativa L. species. This means we cannot attribute any effects to indica or sativa, but rather, to the entourage effect that occurs with all strains of marijuana when they enter the human body. The entourage effect is the belief that cannabinoids (not just THC), terpenes, and flavonoids all work together to create a unique experience in each of us. <br />
                  So what does this mean for hybrid marijuana? It means that it&rsquo;s really not all that different from indica or sativa. It is a mix of the two different strains and can have unique effects from person to person. <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>What Are the Popular Hybrid Strains?</strong><br />
                  Because the majority of the cannabis flower available in dispensaries is considered hybrid, there are many strains that could make this list. Somehow, we managed to cull it down to our top five favorite hybrid strains:<br />
                  Cannatonic: Cannatonic is a unique and popular hybrid strain for a reason: Its CBD content is higher than its THC content: 12% to 7% respectively. Cannatonic is a medicinal marijuana strain with an earthy smell but a surprising, citrus flavor. <br />
                  <br />
                  White Widow: This balanced hybrid has been popular since the 1990s when it first entered Dutch coffee shops. Now, it continues to be popular for consumers and growers. It has helped produce other popular hybrid strains including White Russian, White Rhino and Blue Widow. <br />
                  <br />
                  Wedding Cake aka Triangle Mints #23: This hybrid is a good example of an indica-dominant strain. It has a sweet, tangy flavor to it, likely in part due to its rich limonene terpene profile, and it has won awards, including the Leafly Strain of the Year in 2019. One thing to note: This flower has high THC content at around 25% so make sure to dose carefully. <br />
                  <br />
                  Runtz aka Runtz OG: Cross Zkittlez and Gelato, and you get this fruity-sweet hybrid. Like Wedding Cake, this strain won Leafly Strain of the Year but in 2020. The buds are rich in resin and the actual flower comes in multiple shades that range from purple to lime green. <br />
                  <br />
                  Pineapple Express: This hybrid is a good example of a sativa-dominant strain. It was created by crossing Trainwreck with Hawaiian and became famous when a movie by the same name was released in 2008. Pineapple Express tastes citrusy sweet with pineapple undertones. <br />
                  <br />
                  The availability of each strain depends on a variety of factors, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to visit your local cannabis dispensaries and ask about a couple of different hybrid marijuana strains on the list. The cannabis experts there can help you find a few different strains to try.<br />
                  Prepare for your first dispensary visit with our how-to guide. <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How Do You Ingest Hybrids?</strong><br />
                  You can ingest cannabis hybrid strains the way you ingest any type of marijuana. You can vape, smoke, eat, or drink your hybrid product. Because hybrid marijuana includes both sativa and indica genetics, it&rsquo;s a little easier to find a variety of product types that offer a hybrid experience. These include things like marijuana drinks and even premium cannabis flower. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s important to decide how you want to experience marijuana first, and from there, decide on the products you want to try. And if you need help along the way, we&rsquo;re here. <br />

                  Is Hybrid Cannabis Right for Me?</strong><br />
                  Only you know the answer to this question. Cannabis is an entirely personal experience, and while you can research strains online to see how other consumers experience them, only you can know how the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids in a strain will affect you when you try them. That&rsquo;s why we recommend visiting your licensed dispensary and talking to a cannabis expert. They can help you find budget-friendly options that allow you to try strains before investing too much into them. <br />
                  As always, start slow and with a low dose. This will ensure you have the best experience with your cannabis product. <br />
